# Quest Board System Implementation

## Overview

A fully server-authoritative quest board system where players interact with physical quest boards to receive, pin, and complete crafting quests from 18 different adventurer NPCs.

## Key Features

### Quest Generation
- **5 quests per player** generated on first interaction or after 24-hour reset
- **18 Adventurer Types** with thematic item requests:
  - Knight, Archer, Mage, Alchemist, Merchant, Lord/Noble
  - Blacksmith, Builder, Chef, Priest, Farmer, Jeweler
  - Carpenter, General, Guild Master, Collector, Tanner, Innkeeper

- **Smart Item Selection**: Each adventurer requests 1-3 items from their themed item pool
- **Complexity-Based Quantities**: Items requested in quantities of 1-5

### Rewards
- **Gold**: 1.2x the combined sell value of requested items (minimum 10 gold)
- **XP**: 50% of gold reward (minimum 5 XP)
- Full level-up support with energy max updates

### Quest Management
- **Personal 24h Reset**: Quests reset 24 hours after player's first interaction
- **Pin System**: Players can pin one quest at a time for easy tracking
- **Completion Tracking**: Statistics saved per player (total completed, by adventurer type)

## Implementation Details

### Server-Side Components

#### 1. Quest Data Structure
**File**: `source/common/gameplay/quests/quest.gd`
- Quest resource with ID, adventurer type, required items, rewards, timestamps
- Serialization methods for network transmission

#### 2. Quest Board Interaction Area
**Files**:
- `source/common/gameplay/maps/components/interaction_areas/quest_board/quest_board_area.gd`
- `source/common/gameplay/maps/components/interaction_areas/quest_board/quest_board_area.tscn`
- Extends InteractionArea, tracks players at board, emits signals

#### 3. Quest Manager
**File**: `source/server/world/components/quest_manager.gd`
- Manages per-player quest state (quests, reset times, statistics)
- Generates quests with thematic item selection
- Handles quest completion with inventory checks
- Awards gold, XP, and tracks level-ups
- Persists statistics to PlayerResource

#### 4. Data Request Handlers
**Files**:
- `source/server/world/components/data_request_handlers/quest.fetch.gd`
  - Fetches player's current quests
  - Generates new quests if needed
  
- `source/server/world/components/data_request_handlers/quest.complete.gd`
  - Validates player has required items
  - Checks player is at quest board
  - Removes items, awards gold/XP
  - Updates quest list
  
- `source/server/world/components/data_request_handlers/quest.pin.gd`
  - Toggles pin status on quests
  - Updates quest list

**Handler Registration**:
- `source/common/registry/indexes/data_request_handlers_index.tres` (modified)
  - Added entries for `quest.fetch` (ID 32), `quest.complete` (ID 33), `quest.pin` (ID 34)
  - Updated version to 1760000100, next_id to 35
  - Required for the server to dynamically load handlers via ContentRegistry

#### 5. Server Integration
**File**: `source/server/world/components/instance_server.gd` (modified)
- Added QuestManager to instance
- Quest board enter/exit notifications via `quest_board.status` data push

#### 6. Player Statistics
**File**: `source/common/gameplay/characters/player/player_resource.gd` (modified)
- Added `quest_stats` dictionary for tracking completion data

### Client-Side Components

#### 1. Quest Board UI
**Files**:
- `source/client/ui/quest_board/quest_board_menu.gd`
- `source/client/ui/quest_board/quest_board_menu.tscn`

Features:
- Auto-opens when player enters quest board area
- Displays all 5 quests with:
  - Adventurer type
  - **Item Slot Display**: Required items shown as panels with icons (3 per row)
  - **Interactive Tooltips**: Hover over items to see detailed information
  - Color-coded availability indicators (X/Y format - green when available, red when missing)
  - Gold and XP rewards
  - Pin/Complete buttons
- **Smart Quest Ordering**:
  - Quests sorted by gold reward (lowest to highest)
  - Pinned quests always appear at the top
- **Pin/Unpin Functionality**:
  - Click "Pin" to pin a quest to the top
  - Click "Unpin" to remove pin and return to sorted order
  - Only one quest can be pinned at a time
- Pin indicator shows which quest is pinned (⭐ PINNED)
- Complete button disabled until player has all required items
- Notification system for quest completion
- **Camera Zoom Disabled**: Mouse wheel reserved for scrolling through quests (no camera zoom while quest board is open)

#### 2. HUD Integration
**File**: `source/client/ui/hud/hud.gd` (modified)
- Quest board menu preloaded and added to SubMenu layer
- Automatically responds to `quest_board.status` network events

#### 3. Network Subscriptions
Quest board menu subscribes to:
- `quest_board.status`: Show/hide UI when entering/leaving board
- `quest.update`: Refresh quest list after pin/complete
- `inventory.update`: Update quest item availability display

## World Placement

Quest boards added to:
- **test_market map**: `source/common/gameplay/maps/maps/test_market/test_market.tscn`
  - Position: (200, 100) near the market area

Additional boards can be easily placed in other maps by instantiating:
`res://source/common/gameplay/maps/components/interaction_areas/quest_board/quest_board_area.tscn`

## Testing the System

### 1. Start the Server
Launch the game server with the test_market map loaded.

### 2. Test Quest Generation
- Walk player to position (200, 100) to enter quest board area
- Quest board UI should automatically open
- Verify 5 quests are generated with different adventurer types

### 3. Test Quest Display
- Check that each quest shows:
  - Adventurer type name
  - Required items with quantities
  - Color-coded availability (green=have, red=need)
  - Gold and XP rewards
  - Pin and Complete buttons

### 4. Test Pin Functionality
- Click "Pin" on a quest
- Verify quest shows "⭐ PINNED" indicator
- Pin another quest - first should unpin automatically

### 5. Test Quest Completion
- Use admin command to give required items: `/give <item_name> <quantity>`
- Complete button should become enabled when player has all items
- Click "Complete"
- Verify:
  - Items removed from inventory
  - Gold awarded (check gold display)
  - XP awarded (check level display)
  - Quest removed from list
  - Completion notification shown

### 6. Test 24h Reset
- Method 1: Wait 24 hours (not practical)
- Method 2: Temporarily modify `RESET_INTERVAL_SECONDS` in quest_manager.gd to 60 seconds for testing
- Leave and re-enter quest board after reset time
- Verify new quests are generated

### 7. Test Statistics Tracking
- Complete several quests
- Check player resource quest_stats dictionary contains:
  - `total_completed`: integer count
  - `by_adventurer`: dictionary with counts per adventurer type

## Future Dynamic Events Extension

The system is designed to easily support dynamic events:

### Planned Features
1. **Event-Based Quests**: Generate special event quests during active events
2. **Price Multipliers**: Adjust rewards based on event type (War, Famine, etc.)
3. **Event Duration**: 20-minute timed events with 3 special event quests
4. **Temporary Quest Pool**: Event quests displayed alongside regular quests

### Implementation Path
The `QuestManager` can be extended with:
- `active_event: String` - Current event type
- `event_quests: Dictionary` - Per-player event quest lists
- `event_expires_at: float` - Event end timestamp
- Modified reward calculation based on event multipliers
- Broadcast event updates to all players
