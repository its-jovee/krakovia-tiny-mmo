# EXP and Level-Up System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete EXP and leveling system where players gain experience from harvesting based on node tier (T1-T6), with an exponential progression curve capping at level 30.

## Implemented Features

### 1. PlayerResource - EXP Tracking
**File**: `source/common/gameplay/characters/player/player_resource.gd`

- Added `experience: int` field to track player EXP
- Added `MAX_LEVEL` constant set to 30
- Updated `level_up()` to reset EXP and enforce level cap
- Added helper methods:
  - `get_exp_for_level(lvl)`: Returns required EXP (level * 100)
  - `get_exp_required()`: Returns EXP needed for next level
  - `get_exp_progress()`: Returns progress as float (0.0-1.0)
  - `can_level_up()`: Checks if player has enough EXP to level

### 2. Harvest System - EXP Rewards
**File**: `source/server/world/components/harvesting/harvest_node.gd`

- Modified item distribution to count total items received
- Added EXP calculation based on tier and item count
- Tier-based EXP per item: T1=5, T2=10, T3=15, T4=20, T5=25, T6=30 XP
- Added `_calculate_exp_per_item()`: Returns tier * 5
- Added `_award_exp_for_items()`: Handles EXP awarding and level-up logic
- Sends `exp.update` notification on EXP gain/level-up
- Includes `exp_gained` in `harvest.item_received` notification

### 3. Data Request Handler
**New File**: `source/server/world/components/data_request_handlers/level.get.gd`

- Handles client requests for current level/EXP data
- Returns level, experience, exp_required, and exp_progress

### 4. HUD - Level/EXP Display
**Files**: `source/client/ui/hud/hud.gd` and `hud.tscn`

- Added LevelDisplay panel showing:
  - Current level as text ("Level X")
  - Progress bar showing EXP progress to next level
- Subscribes to `exp.update` events
- Requests initial level data on ready
- Updates display in real-time as player gains EXP
- Positioned at top-left below gold display

### 5. Level-Up Popup
**New Files**: 
- `source/client/ui/hud/level_up_popup.gd`
- `source/client/ui/hud/level_up_popup.tscn`

- Displays "LEVEL UP! Level X" message
- Animated with fade-in, scale bounce, and fade-out
- Shows for 3 seconds then auto-removes
- Positioned at screen center
- Includes AudioStreamPlayer for sound effect (needs sound file)

### 6. Enhanced Harvest Popup
**Files**: 
- `source/client/ui/hud/harvest_popup.gd`
- `source/client/ui/hud/harvest_popup.tscn`

- Added ExpLabel to show "+X XP" alongside item notifications
- Calculates per-item EXP distribution
- Shows EXP in cyan color for visual distinction

## Progression Details

### Level Requirements (Exponential)
- Level 2: 200 XP
- Level 3: 300 XP
- Level 4: 400 XP
- ...
- Level 30: 3000 XP
- Total to reach max level: ~46,500 XP

### EXP Gain by Tier
- T1 nodes: 5 XP per item
- T2 nodes: 10 XP per item
- T3 nodes: 15 XP per item
- T4 nodes: 20 XP per item
- T5 nodes: 25 XP per item
- T6 nodes: 30 XP per item

## Example: Reaching Level 2
- Requires 200 XP total
- T1 nodes: 40 items needed
- T3 nodes: ~14 items needed
- T6 nodes: ~7 items needed

## To-Do (Optional Enhancement)
- Add sound effect file for level-up notification at `assets/audio/sfx/level_up.wav`
- Assign the sound file to the AudioStreamPlayer in `level_up_popup.tscn`

## Testing Notes
- Players start at level 1 with 0 EXP (unless existing save data has different values)
- Multiple level-ups can occur in a single harvest session if enough EXP is gained
- EXP progress bar resets to 0 after each level-up
- At max level (30), players no longer gain EXP
- Level-up grants 3 attribute points per level (existing ATTRIBUTE_POINTS_PER_LEVEL constant)

## Network Protocol
- `level.get` (request): Returns current level/EXP state
- `exp.update` (push): Notifies client of EXP changes and level-ups
- `harvest.item_received` (push): Includes `exp_gained` field
