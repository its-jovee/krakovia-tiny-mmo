# Horse Racing Minigame - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

All components of the horse racing minigame system have been successfully implemented according to the plan, including the **location-based invitation system** using Minigame Zones.

## üìÅ Files Created

### Server-Side Components
1. **`source/server/world/components/minigame_manager.gd`**
   - Manages game sessions and invitations
   - 15-minute recurring timer for automatic invitations
   - **Zone-based invitations**: Sends popups only to players in designated zones
   - Sends 1-minute warning announcement to all players
   - Extensible architecture for multiple game types

2. **`source/server/world/components/minigames/minigame_zone.gd` & `.tscn`**
   - Area2D that tracks players entering/exiting
   - Auto-registers with MinigameManager
   - Determines who receives popup invitations
   - Can be placed on any map (see `MINIGAME_ZONE_SETUP.md`)

3. **`source/server/world/components/minigames/horse_racing_game.gd`**
   - Complete horse racing game logic
   - Betting phase (60 seconds)
   - Race simulation with 30-second duration
   - Proportional prize distribution (70% to 1st, 30% to 2nd)
   - Handles disconnections (bets forfeit)

4. **Data Request Handlers:**
   - `source/server/world/components/data_request_handlers/minigame.join.gd`
   - `source/server/world/components/data_request_handlers/minigame.bet.gd`
   - `source/server/world/components/data_request_handlers/minigame.ready.gd`
   - `source/server/world/components/data_request_handlers/minigame.leave.gd`

5. **Chat Commands:**
   - `source/server/world/components/chat_command/join_command.gd` - Player command to join games
   - `source/server/world/components/chat_command/startgame_command.gd` - Admin command for testing

### Client-Side Components
1. **`source/client/ui/minigame/invitation_popup.tscn` & `.gd`**
   - Popup notification for game invitations
   - Join/Dismiss buttons
   - Auto-dismiss after 30 seconds

2. **`source/client/ui/minigame/horse_racing_ui.tscn` & `.gd`**
   - Complete game interface with three phases:
     - **Betting Phase**: Horse selection, bet input, ready button, player list
     - **Racing Phase**: Animated race with progress bars
     - **Results Phase**: Winner display and earnings

### Integration
- **`source/server/world/components/instance_manager.gd`** - Added MinigameManager initialization
- **`source/client/ui/ui.tscn` & `.gd`** - Integrated minigame UIs and subscriptions

## üéÆ How to Use

### Setting Up a Zone (For Map Designers)
1. Open your map scene (e.g., `overworld.tscn`)
2. Instance `source/server/world/components/minigames/minigame_zone.tscn`
3. Position it where you want players to gather
4. Adjust the collision shape size as needed
5. See `MINIGAME_ZONE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

### For Players
1. **T-1 minute**: See announcement: "üéÆ Horse Racing starting in 1 minute at the Game Arena! Hurry over to join!"
2. Travel to the Game Arena zone
3. **T-0**: If you're in the zone, receive a popup with "Join Game" button (or type `/join`)
4. Select a horse (Thunder, Lightning, Storm, Blaze, or Shadow)
5. Enter bet amount in gold
6. Click "Ready" when satisfied
7. Watch the 30-second race
8. Receive winnings if your horse wins 1st or 2nd place!

### For Admins (Testing)
1. Use `/selfadmin` to grant admin privileges (debug mode)
2. Use `/startgame` to trigger immediate game invitation
3. Use `/setgold @playername 1000` to give testing gold
4. Join and test the full game flow

## üîß Technical Features

### Race Logic
- **Random outcome**: Each horse gets random speed multiplier
- **Smooth animation**: Position updates every 100ms during 30-second race
- **Proportional winnings**: Players who bet on winning horses split the prize pool proportionally to their bet amounts

### Prize Distribution Example
Total pot: 1000 gold
- Horse 1 (Winner): Player A bet 100, Player B bet 200 (total 300)
  - First place pool: 700 gold (70%)
  - Player A gets: 700 √ó (100/300) = 233 gold
  - Player B gets: 700 √ó (200/300) = 467 gold

- Horse 2 (Second): Player C bet 150, Player D bet 150 (total 300)
  - Second place pool: 300 gold (30%)
  - Player C gets: 300 √ó (150/300) = 150 gold
  - Player D gets: 300 √ó (150/300) = 150 gold

### Network Architecture
- **Server authoritative**: All game logic runs on server
- **Real-time updates**: Clients receive state updates via data_push
- **Instance-agnostic**: Players from different map instances can play together
- **Disconnect handling**: Automatic bet forfeiture on disconnect

## üöÄ Future Extensibility

The system is designed to easily add more minigames:

```gdscript
// Add to MinigameManager.available_games
var available_games: Array[String] = ["horse_racing", "hot_potato", "wheel_fortune"]

// Create new game class
class_name HotPotatoGame extends Node
# Implement game logic...

// Update create_game_session()
match game_type:
    "hot_potato":
        return HotPotatoGame.new()
```

## üìã Configuration

### Timing (adjustable in code)
- **Invitation Interval**: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
- **Pre-Start Warning**: 60 seconds (players travel to zone)
- **Invitation Duration**: 30 seconds
- **Betting Phase**: 60 seconds
- **Race Duration**: 30 seconds

### Game Limits
- **Max Players**: 12 per game
- **Number of Horses**: 5
