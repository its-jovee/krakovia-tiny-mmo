   - Join/Dismiss buttons
   - Auto-dismiss after 30 seconds

2. **`source/client/ui/minigame/horse_racing_ui.tscn` & `.gd`**
   - Complete game interface with three phases:
     - **Betting Phase**: Horse selection, bet input, ready button, player list
     - **Racing Phase**: Animated race with progress bars
     - **Results Phase**: Winner display and earnings

### Integration
- **`source/server/world/components/instance_manager.gd`** - Added MinigameManager initialization
- **`source/client/ui/ui.tscn` & `.gd`** - Integrated minigame UIs and subscriptions

## üéÆ How to Use

### For Players
1. Wait for invitation message: "üéÆ Horse Racing is starting! Type /join to participate!"
2. Type `/join` in chat OR click "Join Game" button in popup
3. Select a horse (Thunder, Lightning, Storm, Blaze, or Shadow)
4. Enter bet amount in gold
5. Click "Ready" when satisfied
6. Watch the 30-second race
7. Receive winnings if your horse wins 1st or 2nd place!

### For Admins (Testing)
1. Use `/selfadmin` to grant admin privileges (debug mode)
2. Use `/startgame` to trigger immediate game invitation
3. Use `/setgold @playername 1000` to give testing gold
4. Join and test the full game flow

## üîß Technical Features

### Race Logic
- **Random outcome**: Each horse gets random speed multiplier
- **Smooth animation**: Position updates every 100ms during 30-second race
- **Proportional winnings**: Players who bet on winning horses split the prize pool proportionally to their bet amounts

### Prize Distribution Example
Total pot: 1000 gold
- Horse 1 (Winner): Player A bet 100, Player B bet 200 (total 300)
  - First place pool: 700 gold (70%)
  - Player A gets: 700 √ó (100/300) = 233 gold
  - Player B gets: 700 √ó (200/300) = 467 gold

- Horse 2 (Second): Player C bet 150, Player D bet 150 (total 300)
  - Second place pool: 300 gold (30%)
  - Player C gets: 300 √ó (150/300) = 150 gold
  - Player D gets: 300 √ó (150/300) = 150 gold

### Network Architecture
- **Server authoritative**: All game logic runs on server
- **Real-time updates**: Clients receive state updates via data_push
- **Instance-agnostic**: Players from different map instances can play together
- **Disconnect handling**: Automatic bet forfeiture on disconnect

## üöÄ Future Extensibility

The system is designed to easily add more minigames:

```gdscript
// Add to MinigameManager.available_games
var available_games: Array[String] = ["horse_racing", "hot_potato", "wheel_fortune"]

// Create new game class
class_name HotPotatoGame extends Node
# Implement game logic...

// Update create_game_session()
match game_type:
    "hot_potato":
        return HotPotatoGame.new()
```

## üìã Configuration

### Timing (adjustable in code)
- **Invitation Interval**: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
- **Invitation Duration**: 30 seconds
- **Betting Phase**: 60 seconds
- **Race Duration**: 30 seconds

### Game Limits
- **Max Players**: 12 per game
- **Number of Horses**: 5
- **Minimum Bet**: None (can be added if desired)
